## Abstract

- **Background** Understanding seed germination phenology is crucial for
  predicting plant species responses to environmental changes. However,
  a substantial gap persists regarding how microclimatic conditions
  influence germination timing in different ecosystems.
- **Methods** We conducted a continuous seasonal experiment with fresh
  seeds to investigate germination phenology in 54 species from
  temperate and Mediterranean alpine communities. Using field
  microclimatic data series, we mimicked fellfield sites (snow-free
  conditions and warmer temperatures); and snowbed sites (long snow
  cover and cooler temperatures). The laboratory experiments were
  complemented with field sowing experiments.
- **Key Results** The analysis of phenology traits showed similar
  responses of species from Mediterranean and temperate macroclimates to
  microclimatic variation, with a consistent germination delay in
  snowbed compared to fellfield conditions. This effect was complemented
  by reduced dormancy and increased autumn germination observed in seeds
  from the Mediterranean system. Seed phenology in the field generally
  supported the results from laboratory experiments.
- **Conclusions** Our results suggest a generalizable and predictable
  phenological shift in the germination of alpine plants along
  microclimatic gradients. In a warming scenario with reduced snow
  cover, alpine species are expected to anticipate seed germination
  between 60 and 45 days on average, with potential disrupting effects
  on plant communities from either Mediterranean or temperate
  macroclimates.
