# Microclimate regulates germination phenology in alpine plant communities

This repository stores all the information related to the manuscript [*Microclimatic variation regulates seed germination phenology in alpine plant communities*](add doi once manuscript is accepted), including the raw datasets, the scripts to perform data cleaning, analysis and figures. 

## Contents

This repository is organised following the advice of [Wilson et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) for recording and storing research projects.


The following materials are available in the folders of this repository:

* `data` Data files including the 
[Raw germination data from the laboratory experiments](https://github.com/clara-espinosa/Germination_phenology/blob/main/data/clean%20data.csv) and 
[Germination data from the field sowing experiments](https://github.com/clara-espinosa/Germination_phenology/blob/main/data/field_germination.csv), 
[Species information](https://github.com/clara-espinosa/Germination_phenology/blob/main/data/all_info.csv) datasets;  [CHELSA bioclimatic variables for the study system](https://github.com/clara-espinosa/Germination_phenology/blob/main/data/Bioclim_study_area.csv) for figure 1b, 
[Temperatures recorded in the field from 2008 to 2019](https://github.com/clara-espinosa/Germination_phenology/blob/main/data/temp_picos_raw.csv) then  transformed into [Weekly temperature records for visualization](https://github.com/clara-espinosa/Germination_phenology/blob/main/data/weekly_picos_graph.csv) in figure 1c and

It also includes the [Mean germination trait values table ](https://github.com/clara-espinosa/Germination_phenology/blob/main/data/meanvalues_graph.csv) and the [Efects sizes from MCMC-GLMM models](https://github.com/clara-espinosa/Germination_phenology/blob/main/data/test_effectsize.csv) for figure 4.
Finally a [Metadata file](https://github.com/clara-espinosa/Germination_phenology/blob/main/data/metadata.csv) explaining each csv variables. 
* `doc` Files required for the submission??,
* `results` Output of the `R` scripts, including figures,models and phylogenetic trees.
* `src` Scripts in `R` language used to clean the raw data, perform the analyses of the manuscript and create the figures.

## Abstract

* **Background** Understanding seed germination phenology is crucial for predicting plant responses to environmental changes. However, a substantial gap persists regarding how microclimatic conditions influence germination in seasonal ecosystems.  
* **Methods** We conducted a continuous seasonal experiment with fresh seeds to investigate germination phenology in 54 species from temperate and Mediterranean alpine communities. Using field microclimatic data series, we mimicked fellfield and snowbed conditions in growth chambers and we carried out field sowing experiments.  
* **Key Results** Both communities showed similar phenology responses to microclimatic variation, finding a consistent germination delay in snowbed compared to fellfield conditions. This effect was complemented by reduced dormancy and increased autumn germination in Mediterranean seeds.
* **Conclusions** Our results suggest a predictable phenological shift in the germination of alpine plants along microclimatic gradients. In warmer conditions with reduced snow cover, alpine species are expected to anticipate germination 52 days on average, with potential disrupting effects on cold-adapted plant communities.
